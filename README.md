Healthcare chatbots are artificial intelligence (AI) powered software applications that interact with users in the healthcare industry and offer customized support and information. In order to comprehend and respond to user inquiries, these chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) techniques. They assist with symptom analysis, triage, diagnosis, treatment recommendations, patient monitoring, and health education. Healthcare chatbots have several benefits. Users can get 24/7 access to healthcare information and assistance because they provide immediate and accessible support. They can offer initial guidance and assist patients in assessing symptoms, assessing the seriousness of medical conditions. Chatbots can analyze a lot of medical data by using deep learning algorithms, which increases the precision of diagnoses and treatment suggestions. By educating patients on health-related issues, encouraging healthy habits, and helping with medication reminders, they can also increase patient engagement.
